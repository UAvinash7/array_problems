Problem Statement

An arcade game player wants to climb to the top of the leaderboard and track their ranking. The game uses Dense Ranking, so its leaderboard works like this:

The player with the highest score is ranked number 1 on the leaderboard.

Players who have equal scores receive the same ranking number, and the next player(s) receive the immediately following ranking number.

Example

ranked = [100, 90, 90, 80]
player = [70, 80, 105]

The ranked players will have ranks 1, 2, 2, and 3, respectively. If the player's scores are 70, 80 and 105, their rankings after each game are 4th, 3rd and 1st. Return [4, 3, 1].

Function Description

Complete the climbingLeaderboard function in the editor below.

climbingLeaderboard has the following parameter(s):

int ranked[n]: the leaderboard scores
int player[m]: the player's scores

Returns

int[m]: the player's rank after each new score

Input Format

The first line contains an integer n, the number of players on the leaderboard.
The next line contains n space-separated integers ranked[i], the leaderboard scores in decreasing order.
The next line contains an integer, m, the number games the player plays.
The last line contains m space-separated integers player[j], the game scores.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 2 * 10 ^ 5
1 <= m <= 2 * 10 ^ 5
0 <= ranked[i] <= 10 ^ 9 for 0 <= i < n
0 <= player[j] <= 10 ^ 9 for 0 <= j < m

The existing leaderboard, ranked, is in descending order.
The player's scores, player, are in ascending order.

Subtask

For 60% of the maximum score:

1 <= n <= 200
1 <= m <= 200

Sample Input 1

Array: ranked
100 100 50 40 40 20 10		i = 7 (i.e., length of array: ranked)

Array: player
5 25 50 120					j = 4 (i.e., length of array: player)

Sample Output 1

Explanation 1

Alice starts playing with 7 players already on the leaderboard, which looks like this:

Rank	Name		Score
1		Emma		100
1		David		100
2		Caroline	50
3		Ritika		40
3		Tom			40
4		Heraldo		20
5		Riley		10

After Alice finishes game 0, her score is 5 and her ranking is 6:

Rank	Name		Score
1		Emma		100
1		David		100
2		Caroline	50
3		Ritika		40
3		Tom			40
4		Heraldo		20
5		Riley		10
6		Alice		5

After Alice finishes game 1, her score is 25 and her ranking is 4:

Rank	Name		Score
1		Emma		100
1		David		100
2		Caroline	50
3		Ritika		40
3		Tom			40
4		Alice		25
5		Heraldo		20
6		Riley		10

After Alice finishes game 2, her score is 50 and her ranking is tied with Caroline at 2:

Rank	Name		Score
1		Emma		100
1		David		100
2		Caroline	50
2		Alice		50
3		Ritika		40
3		Tom			40
4		Heraldo		20
5		Riley		10

After Alice finishes game 3, her score is 120 and her ranking is 1:

Rank	Name		Score
1		Alice		120
2		Emma		100
2		David		100
3		Caroline	50
4		Ritika		40
4		Tom			40
5		Heraldo		20
6		Riley		10

Sample Input 2

Array: ranked
100 90 90 80 75 60			i = 6 (i.e., length of array: ranked)

Array: player
50 65 77 90 102				j = 5 (i.e., length of array: player)

Sample Output 2
