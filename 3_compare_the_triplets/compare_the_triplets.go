Problem Statement

Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

The rating for Alice's challenge is the triplet a = (a[0], a[1], a[2]), and the rating for Bob's challenge is the triplet b = (b[0], b[1], b[2]).

The task is to calculate their comparison points by comparing each category:

If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.

Example

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [3, 2, 1]

For elements `0`, Bob is awarded a point because a[0] < b[0].
For the equal elements a[1] and b[1], no points are earned.
Finally, for elements 2, a[2] > b[2] so Alice receives a point.

The return array is [1, 1] with Alice's score first and Bob's second.

Function Description

Complete the function compareTriplets with the following parameter(s):

int a[3]: Alice's challenge rating
int b[3]: Bob's challenge rating

Returns

int[2]: the first element is Alice's score and the second is Bob's score

Input Format

The first line contains 3 space-separated integers, a[0], a[1], and a[2], the respective values in triplet a.
The second line contains 3 space-separated integers, b[0], b[1], and b[2], the respective values in triplet b.

Constraints

1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100
1 ≤ b[i] ≤ 100

Sample Input 0

5 6 7
3 6 10

Sample Output 0

1 1

Explanation 0

In this example:

a = (a[0], a[1], a[2]) = (5, 6, 7)
b = (b[0], b[1], b[2]) = (3, 6, 10)

Now, let's compare each individual score:

a[0] > b[0], so Alice receives 1 point.
a[1] = b[1], so nobody receives a point.
a[2] < b[2], so Bob receives 1 point.

Alice's comparison score is 1, and Bob's comparison score is 1. Thus, we return the array [1, 1].

Sample Input 1

17 28 30
99 16 8

Sample Output 1

2 1

Explanation 1

Comparing the 0th elements, 17 <  99 so Bob receives a point.
Comparing the 1st and 2nd elements, 28 > 16 and 30 > 8 so Alice receives two points.
The return array is [2, 1].

}

/*

Run the code by using command `go run compare_the_triplets.go`
After that enter the value of array variable a and variable b
And you will get the comparison result of the array variables a and b.
